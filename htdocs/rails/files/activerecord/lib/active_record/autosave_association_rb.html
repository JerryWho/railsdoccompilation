    <pre>module ActiveRecord
  # AutosaveAssociation is a module that takes care of automatically saving
  # your associations when the parent is saved. In addition to saving, it
  # also destroys any associations that were marked for destruction.
  # (See mark_for_destruction and marked_for_destruction?)
  #
  # Saving of the parent, its associations, and the destruction of marked
  # associations, all happen inside 1 transaction. This should never leave the
  # database in an inconsistent state after, for instance, mass assigning
  # attributes and saving them.
  #
  # If validations for any of the associations fail, their error messages will
  # be applied to the parent.
  #
  # Note that it also means that associations marked for destruction won't
  # be destroyed directly. They will however still be marked for destruction.
  #
  # === One-to-one Example
  #
  # Consider a Post model with one Author:
  #
  #   class Post
  #     has_one :author, :autosave =&gt; true
  #   end
  #
  # Saving changes to the parent and its associated model can now be performed
  # automatically _and_ atomically:
  #
  #   post = Post.find(1)
  #   post.title # =&gt; &quot;The current global position of migrating ducks&quot;
  #   post.author.name # =&gt; &quot;alloy&quot;
  #
  #   post.title = &quot;On the migration of ducks&quot;
  #   post.author.name = &quot;Eloy Duran&quot;
  #
  #   post.save
  #   post.reload
  #   post.title # =&gt; &quot;On the migration of ducks&quot;
  #   post.author.name # =&gt; &quot;Eloy Duran&quot;
  #
  # Destroying an associated model, as part of the parent's save action, is as
  # simple as marking it for destruction:
  #
  #   post.author.mark_for_destruction
  #   post.author.marked_for_destruction? # =&gt; true
  #
  # Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
  #   id = post.author.id
  #   Author.find_by_id(id).nil? # =&gt; false
  #
  #   post.save
  #   post.reload.author # =&gt; nil
  #
  # Now it _is_ removed from the database:
  #   Author.find_by_id(id).nil? # =&gt; true
  #
  # === One-to-many Example
  #
  # Consider a Post model with many Comments:
  #
  #   class Post
  #     has_many :comments, :autosave =&gt; true
  #   end
  #
  # Saving changes to the parent and its associated model can now be performed
  # automatically _and_ atomically:
  #
  #   post = Post.find(1)
  #   post.title # =&gt; &quot;The current global position of migrating ducks&quot;
  #   post.comments.first.body # =&gt; &quot;Wow, awesome info thanks!&quot;
  #   post.comments.last.body # =&gt; &quot;Actually, your article should be named differently.&quot;
  #
  #   post.title = &quot;On the migration of ducks&quot;
  #   post.comments.last.body = &quot;Actually, your article should be named differently. [UPDATED]: You are right, thanks.&quot;
  #
  #   post.save
  #   post.reload
  #   post.title # =&gt; &quot;On the migration of ducks&quot;
  #   post.comments.last.body # =&gt; &quot;Actually, your article should be named differently. [UPDATED]: You are right, thanks.&quot;
  #
  # Destroying one of the associated models members, as part of the parent's
  # save action, is as simple as marking it for destruction:
  #
  #   post.comments.last.mark_for_destruction
  #   post.comments.last.marked_for_destruction? # =&gt; true
  #   post.comments.length # =&gt; 2
  #
  # Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
  #   id = post.comments.last.id
  #   Comment.find_by_id(id).nil? # =&gt; false
  #
  #   post.save
  #   post.reload.comments.length # =&gt; 1
  #
  # Now it _is_ removed from the database:
  #   Comment.find_by_id(id).nil? # =&gt; true
  #
  # === Validation
  #
  # Validation is performed on the parent as usual, but also on all autosave
  # enabled associations. If any of the associations fail validation, its
  # error messages will be applied on the parents errors object and validation
  # of the parent will fail.
  #
  # Consider a Post model with Author which validates the presence of its name
  # attribute:
  #
  #   class Post
  #     has_one :author, :autosave =&gt; true
  #   end
  #
  #   class Author
  #     validates_presence_of :name
  #   end
  #
  #   post = Post.find(1)
  #   post.author.name = ''
  #   post.save # =&gt; false
  #   post.errors # =&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::Errors:0x174498c @errors={&quot;author_name&quot;=&gt;[&quot;can't be blank&quot;]}, @base=#&lt;Post ...&gt;&gt;
  #
  # No validations will be performed on the associated models when validations
  # are skipped for the parent:
  #
  #   post = Post.find(1)
  #   post.author.name = ''
  #   post.save(false) # =&gt; true
