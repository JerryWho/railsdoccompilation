  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -&gt; highest priority.

  # Sample of regular route:
  #   map.connect 'products/:id', :controller =&gt; 'catalog', :action =&gt; 'view'
  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

  # Sample of named route:
  #   map.purchase 'products/:id/purchase', :controller =&gt; 'catalog', :action =&gt; 'purchase'
  # This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id =&gt; product.id)

  # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   map.resources :products

  # Sample resource route with options:
  #   map.resources :products, :member =&gt; { :short =&gt; :get, :toggle =&gt; :post }, :collection =&gt; { :sold =&gt; :get }

  # Sample resource route with sub-resources:
  #   map.resources :products, :has_many =&gt; [ :comments, :sales ], :has_one =&gt; :seller
  
  # Sample resource route with more complex sub-resources
  #   map.resources :products do |products|
  #     products.resources :comments
  #     products.resources :sales, :collection =&gt; { :recent =&gt; :get }
  #   end

  # Sample resource route within a namespace:
  #   map.namespace :admin do |admin|
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     admin.resources :products
  #   end

  # You can have the root of your site routed with map.root -- just remember to delete public/index.html.
  # map.root :controller =&gt; &quot;welcome&quot;

  # See how all your routes lay out with &quot;rake routes&quot;

  # Install the default routes as the lowest priority.
  # Note: These default routes make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests. You should
  # consider removing or commenting them out if you're using named routes and resources.
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
  map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format'
