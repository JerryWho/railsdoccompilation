module ActionController
  # Superclass for ActionController functional tests. Functional tests allow you to
  # test a single controller action per test method. This should not be confused with
  # integration tests (see ActionController::IntegrationTest), which are more like
  # &quot;stories&quot; that can involve multiple controllers and mutliple actions (i.e. multiple
  # different HTTP requests).
  #
  # == Basic example
  #
  # Functional tests are written as follows:
  # 1. First, one uses the +get+, +post+, +put+, +delete+ or +head+ method to simulate
  #    an HTTP request.
  # 2. Then, one asserts whether the current state is as expected. &quot;State&quot; can be anything:
  #    the controller's HTTP response, the database contents, etc.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   class BooksControllerTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase
  #     def test_create
  #       # Simulate a POST response with the given HTTP parameters.
  #       post(:create, :book =&gt; { :title =&gt; &quot;Love Hina&quot; })
  #
  #       # Assert that the controller tried to redirect us to
  #       # the created book's URI.
  #       assert_response :found
  #
  #       # Assert that the controller really put the book in the database.
  #       assert_not_nil Book.find_by_title(&quot;Love Hina&quot;)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Special instance variables
  #
  # ActionController::TestCase will also automatically provide the following instance
  # variables for use in the tests:
  #
  # &lt;b&gt;@controller&lt;/b&gt;::
  #      The controller instance that will be tested.
  # &lt;b&gt;@request&lt;/b&gt;::
  #      An ActionController::TestRequest, representing the current HTTP
  #      request. You can modify this object before sending the HTTP request. For example,
  #      you might want to set some session properties before sending a GET request.
  # &lt;b&gt;@response&lt;/b&gt;::
  #      An ActionController::TestResponse object, representing the response
  #      of the last HTTP response. In the above example, &lt;tt&gt;@response&lt;/tt&gt; becomes valid
  #      after calling +post+. If the various assert methods are not sufficient, then you
  #      may use this object to inspect the HTTP response in detail.
  #
  # (Earlier versions of Rails required each functional test to subclass
  # Test::Unit::TestCase and define @controller, @request, @response in +setup+.)
  #
  # == Controller is automatically inferred
  #
  # ActionController::TestCase will automatically infer the controller under test
  # from the test class name. If the controller cannot be inferred from the test
  # class name, you can explicity set it with +tests+.
  #
  #   class SpecialEdgeCaseWidgetsControllerTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase
  #     tests WidgetController
  #   end
  #
  # == Testing controller internals
  #
  # In addition to these specific assertions, you also have easy access to various collections that the regular test/unit assertions
  # can be used against. These collections are:
  #
  # * assigns: Instance variables assigned in the action that are available for the view.
  # * session: Objects being saved in the session.
  # * flash: The flash objects currently in the session.
  # * cookies: Cookies being sent to the user on this request.
  #
  # These collections can be used just like any other hash:
  #
  #   assert_not_nil assigns(:person) # makes sure that a @person instance variable was set
  #   assert_equal &quot;Dave&quot;, cookies[:name] # makes sure that a cookie called :name was set as &quot;Dave&quot;
  #   assert flash.empty? # makes sure that there's nothing in the flash
  #
  # For historic reasons, the assigns hash uses string-based keys. So assigns[:person] won't work, but assigns[&quot;person&quot;] will. To
  # appease our yearning for symbols, though, an alternative accessor has been devised using a method call instead of index referencing.
  # So assigns(:person) will work just like assigns[&quot;person&quot;], but again, assigns[:person] will not work.
  #
  # On top of the collections, you have the complete url that a given action redirected to available in redirect_to_url.
  #
  # For redirects within the same controller, you can even call follow_redirect and the redirect will be followed, triggering another
  # action call which can then be asserted against.
  #
  # == Manipulating the request collections
  #
  # The collections described above link to the response, so you can test if what the actions were expected to do happened. But
  # sometimes you also want to manipulate these collections in the incoming request. This is really only relevant for sessions
  # and cookies, though. For sessions, you just do:
  #
  #   @request.session[:key] = &quot;value&quot;
  #   @request.cookies[&quot;key&quot;] = &quot;value&quot;
  #
  # == Testing named routes
  #
  # If you're using named routes, they can be easily tested using the original named routes' methods straight in the test case.
  # Example:
  #
  #  assert_redirected_to page_url(:title =&gt; 'foo')
