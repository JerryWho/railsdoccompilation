    <pre>module Cucumber
  # This module defines the API for programming panguage support in Cucumber.
  # While Cucumber itself is written in Ruby, any programming language can
  # be supported by implementing this API.
  #
  # For the sake of illustration we'll consider an imaginary language called
  # _why. _why files have the .why extension, so we need to put support for
  # this language in the &lt;tt&gt;Cucumber::WhySupport::WhyLanguage&lt;/tt&gt;. This
  # class must be defined in a file called &lt;tt&gt;cucumber/why_support/why_language.rb&lt;/tt&gt;
  # and be available on Ruby's &lt;tt&gt;$LOAD_PATH&lt;/tt&gt;:
  #
  #   module Cucumber
  #     module WhySupport
  #       class WhyLanguage
  #
  #         # Uses whatever available language bridge to load
  #         # +why_file+ and returns an Array of StepDefinition.
  #         def load_code_file(why_file)
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Each language implementation manages its own hooks, and must execute them
  # at appropriate times.
  #
